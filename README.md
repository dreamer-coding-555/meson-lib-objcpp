# Project Template - `Objective C++`

Welcome to the Project Template repository! This README provides user-friendly instructions for setting up, compiling, testing, and running a project using the Meson build system on Windows, macOS, and Linux systems. Please note that the Meson build system is required for successfully building this project.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Meson Build System**: This project relies on Meson. If you don't have Meson installed, visit the official [Meson website](https://mesonbuild.com/Getting-meson.html) for installation instructions.

## Adding dependency

1. **Install Meson Build System**: Before integrating the dependency, ensure you have Meson `1.2` or newer installed on your host system. You can install it with this command.

   ```ini
   python -m pip install meson           # to install Meson
   python -m pip install --upgrade meson # to upgrade Meson
   ```

2. **Adding Wrap File**: You can add a `.wrap`, first go into `subprojects` directory and create `fscl-<name>-objcpp.wrap` next copy the defintion into the file:

   ```ini
   # ======================
   # Git Wrap package definition
   # ======================
   [wrap-git]
   url = https://github.com/fossil-lib/tscl-<name>-objcpp.git
   revision = v2.4.3

   [provide]
   fscl-<name>-cpp = fscl_<name>_objcpp_dep
   ```

3. **Integrate the New Dependency**: After creating the dependency `.wrap` file, you need to integrate it into your Meson project. This typically involves adding the dependency to your `meson.build` file. Here's an example of how you might do that:

   ```ini
   dep = dependency('fscl-<name>-objcpp')
   ```

   This line retrieves the `fscl-<name>-objcpp` dependency, allowing you to use it in your project.

## Configure Options

You have options when configuring the build, each serving a different purpose:

- **Running Tests**: To enable running tests, use `-Dwith_test=enabled` when configuring the build.

   Example:
   
   ```python
   meson setup builddir -Dwith_test=enabled
   ```
